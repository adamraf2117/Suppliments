                            <p>Purpose: This supplement contains a blend of digestive enzymes (protease, lipase, amylase) and bile salts, which support the breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.</p>
                            <p>Relation to Findings: Your results indicated a need for digestive support. Low enzyme production can lead to poor digestion, causing symptoms like bloating and constipation. This enzyme blend helps improve food breakdown and absorption.</p>
                            <p>Benefits: Supports more complete digestion, reduces bloating by preventing undigested food from fermenting in the gut, and can relieve strain on the digestive system, which may improve constipation.</p>

                            <p>Relation to Findings: Inadequate bile production can cause bloating and constipation due to poor fat digestion. This supplement supports bile flow, essential for digesting fats effectively.</p>
                            <p>Benefits: Improves fat digestion, alleviates bloating, and supports liver function, which aids overall detoxification processes. This can help relieve some of the pressure on your digestive system that contributes to your symptoms.</p>

                            <p>Purpose: A targeted probiotic containing Akkermansia muciniphila, a beneficial bacteria that supports gut barrier integrity and microbiome health.</p>
                            <p>Relation to Findings: Your test showed a deficiency in Akkermansia, a bacteria essential for maintaining a healthy gut lining. Low levels can contribute to bloating, poor motility, and gut inflammation.</p>
                            <p>Benefits: Strengthens the gut barrier, promotes motility, and helps maintain a balanced microbiome. This can reduce bloating and support more regular bowel movements.</p>

                            <p>Purpose: Contains spore-based probiotics (Bacillus strains) that are resilient, helping balance the gut microbiome and support digestive health.</p>
                            <p>Relation to Findings: Spore probiotics are effective for managing microbiome imbalances, which were noted in your test. These strains survive the digestive tract, reaching the intestines intact and supporting beneficial bacteria.</p>
                            <p>Benefits: Helps balance the gut microbiome, supports gut health, and reduces inflammation-associated dysbiosis. This can help with both bloating and bowel regularity.</p>
